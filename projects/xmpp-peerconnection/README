This is the place where we are defining how to use PeerConnection from within a
Javascript environment along with our PeerConnection version of the plugin.
But this time we're doing it in XMPP land.

There are some  hardwired notions here like "video.gocast.it" and "conference.video.gocast.it"
are the domains being used in XMPP land.
