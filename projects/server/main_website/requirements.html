        <h2>High level requirements</h2>
        <p>
Currently, our project works on Mac and Linux. Testing has been dev oriented - not professionally QA'd. Our development stations are:
	</p>
	<h3>Mac</h3>
        <p>
Mac OS 10.7.1 and 10.7.2 (Lion) (64-bit systems) using both XCode 4.1 and XCode 4.2. On the Mac, we have had the most success running the plugin under Chrome (15.x) but we have had some success with Firefox in 32-bit mode. (The binaries are 32-bit binaries currently). Safari loads the plugin currently, but it doesn.t function.
<br /><br />
We would love to get feedback from 10.6 (and 32/64-bit) users of Mac and if anyone gets Safari working etc.
<br /><br />
	</p>
	<h3>Linux</h3>
	<p>
For our Linux stations, we use Ubuntu 10.04 (64-bit) and 11.04 (32-bit). 
<br /><br />
Our testing of the plugin has been successful against Chrome (12.x and 14.x).
Our trials with Firefox (5.x) were functional on 32-bit ubuntu but spotty at best on 64-bit. It also appears the release version of the monster monolithic libwebrtc_Release.a file has better results than the libwebrtc_Debug.a version for some reason but no formal investigation has been started here.
<br /><br />
Anyone running different flavors of Linux and/or getting Firefox working - we would love to hear from you.
<br /><br />
	</p>
	<h3>Windows - not yet</h3>
	<p>
Currently we do not support Windows, but we do not see any major impediments to doing so. It was a matter of focus and time for this initial release. The scripts are all sh and bash based and so Windows would need to replicate similar in .bat files or other (ruby / python?). FireBreath supports Windows and WebRTC certainly builds on Windows so there are no foreseen problems.
