The project is relatively automated regarding building and use. But as in many
things, reading the docs is suggested. Full docs are found on the website at 

  http://gocast.it

If you're in a hurry, however, and you're on a Mac or Linux, you should have
good luck in simply running:

  ./prep_webrtc.sh

This will in turn download and build webRTC along with FireBreath and our
plugin. Note that the webrtc repository is over 100MB in size so set some
time aside (unless you've got a fantastic net connection)

The resultant output are found in:
[Linux]
third_party/webrtc/out/[Debug|Release]/
  libwebrtc_*.a
  peerconnection_server
  cmdline_audio_peer

src/js_api/build/bin/WebrtcPlugin/npWebrtcPlugin.so

[Mac]
third_party/webrtc/xcodebuild/[Debug|Release]/
  libwebrtc_*.a
  peerconnection_server
  cmdline_audio_peer
