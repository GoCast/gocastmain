How to build:

Mac version (theoretical):

1. Make sure "gyp" is installed: http://code.google.com/p/gyp/
2. Open terminal, and cd to: /gocastmain/projects/ios/apps/carousel/code/project/common
3. Run ./regyp-mac.sh
4. Open /gocastmain/projects/ios/apps/carousel/code/project/mac/All.xcodeproj
5. Build, and the output will be in: /gocastmain/projects/ios/apps/carousel/code/build/mac/debug
6. Can be run from the debugger, command line, or finder.
