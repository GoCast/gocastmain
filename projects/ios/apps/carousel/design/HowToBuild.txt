How to build:

iOS version:

1. Make sure "gyp" is installed: http://code.google.com/p/gyp/
2. Open terminal, and cd to: /gocastmain/projects/ios/apps/carousel/code/project/common
3. Run ./regyp-ios.sh
4. Open /gocastmain/projects/ios/apps/carousel/code/project/mac/Whiteboard.xcodeproj
5. Build, and the output will be in: /gocastmain/projects/ios/apps/carousel/code/build/mac/debug
6. Can be run in the simulator or on a device.
7. I suggest to change the scheme to "release" instead of debug for demo / app submission purposes, as it's much faster.
