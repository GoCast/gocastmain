GoCast It!
==========

Welcome to the project. The current project produces both monolithic webrtc static libraries
as well as creating a server and set of clients for audio peer-to-peer communication. One
tool is a command line tool while the other is a plugin with Javascript calls for logging in
and out as well as initiating connections and disconnecting connections.

See INSTALL for a brief 'how to' in setup. Or better yet - go to the [website](http://www.gocast.it)
for a great discussion on how to build and how the build works as well as what it produces in more
detail.
